 
Functions created:

"Gcorr_beta_throats"

Call the functions "Gcorr_isos" and "half_ang_isos" to obtain the geometric properties of the throats

"Gcorr_isos"

Corrects the form factor G of an array of figures, assuming that initially G was calculated considering voxealized isosceles triangles.


"half_ang_isos"

Calculate the half corner angles of a group of figures assuming isosceles triangles
#Assumes that 1w-16 <= G <= 0.04811252243

"geo_props_eq_pores"

Calculate the geometric properties of the pores assuming tubes with an equilateral triangle section.
