V1: trim_saddle_network iteration set to 500, legacy on, high accuracy
V2: trim_saddle_network iteration set to 20 (default) (no differences beteen V1)
V3: V1 with sigma = 0.5 (few improves compared to V1)
V4: V1 with sigma= 0.5 and r_max = 5  (few improves compared to V1)
V5: legacy off. trim_saddle iteration to 10 (WARNING, NOT USE MORE THAN THAT),
V6: legacy off, trim_saddle_network iteration set to 10, standard accuracy
V7: V1 but with standard accuracy
